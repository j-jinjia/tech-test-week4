# Pokédom Tech Test (Week 4)
## Requirements
- Using the array of pokémon and your knowledge of DOM manipulation in JavaScript, display information about 151 pokémon on your site
- You will not need to add any new files, and the only file you need to change is `script.js`. However feel free to play around with the `index.html` to find out how all the styles work.
- This should be hosted from your repository using GitHub Pages.

## Notes
- If you haven't used imports in JavaScript before, take a look at the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import). You will need to find out how to import the `pokemonArray` from the `pokemon.js` file into the `script.js` file
- Look at the SCSS file for clues to what the HTML cards should look like
- We're looking for clean code here, make sure you remove extra console.logs and commented code, and remember to format your code!

## Extension
- Add the ability to filter through the pokémon, here are a couple of ideas:
  - Search by name
  - Be able to change the number of results
  - Filter by available types
